# VDSCalculator
Performs calculations for key experiments related to drug screening and DNA/protein purification

## DSF
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry, or DSF, is an experiment that is used for initial high throughput screening to find a potential drug that binds to a target protein by determining the melting points of the protein with and without the possible drug binded. Samples are created with a mixture of chemicals and proteins to determine these melting points at different protein concentrations. There are 3 main "ingredients" in DSF:

* Elutions
* Controls
* Sypro

This code performs the calculations for all these components needed to perform 1 round of DSF successfully.
